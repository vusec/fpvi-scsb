## Setup and Environment

To compile all the code and configure your environment, simply perform the following:

```
make
source config.sh
```

## Repository organization

Every folder contains a separated README with more details. In summary, this is the content of every folder:

* [fp_reverse_engineering](fp_reverse_engineering): utilities to test, understand and verify the
presence of FPVI vulnerability
* [leakers](leakers): example test code to show how every presented machine clear can
be used to read transiently memory
* [leak_rate_win_size](leak_rate_win_size): code to measure leak rate and window size
of various transient execution mechanisms
* [md_reverse_engineering](md_reverse_engineering): experiments to reverse engineer
the memory disambiguation predictor on Intel processor
* [fpvi_firefox_exploit](fpvi_firefox_exploit): Firefox exploit based on FPVI to
leak arbitrary memory locations (CVE-2021-29955).
